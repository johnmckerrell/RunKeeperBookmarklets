# RunKeeper Bookmarklets

A collection of Bookmarklets to run against RunKeeper's website to add functionality. Currently a collection of one part-finished bookmarklet:

## Toggle Units

This bookmarklet will toggle the units used on the page between metric and imperial. Currently works on an activity page just to change the units in the history on the left and the main summary distance at the top.


## Adding Bookmarklets

GitHub doesn't allow bookmarklets to be placed in the readme file so you will need to load the bookmarklets.html file locally, or hopefully [this link](http://johnmckerrell.com/files/RunKeeperBookmarklets/bookmarklets.html) will contain a current version of that file.

On that page you will find one or more links, drag each one to your bookmarks bar or add it to your favourites in whatever way makes sense, then go to the runkeeper site and click on it to activate. The first time you click it will load a javascript file from github with the latest version of the code, following times on the same visit it should use the JavaScript that has just been loaded.
